## Austin For Sale Listings - Project Overview
### Can I get some analysis with those new listings? 
Sure, we can go to the apps and see what is newly being listed. A 3 bed / 2 bath on the eastside for $650,000? That sounds good! With maybe one other listing in that zip code, you could know if the property you like is at a good price. But what if there are 20? Making that comparison is so much harder then. This data engineering project aims to make the shopping experience a bit easier by providing visualizations such as what is the average price of listings in that zip code, how much more or less is a specific listing from the average of the zip code, and other lesser-known statistics.

This would not be possible without [HomeHarvest] (https://github.com/Bunsly/HomeHarvest/tree/master)
